# WEB-SCRAPING-AND-EDA-PROJECT-ON-DOCTOR-S-AVAILABILITY-
In this project, we aim to analyze the availability of doctors in a particular area using web scraping and exploratory data analysis (EDA). The goal is to provide insights into the number of available doctors, their specialties, and their availability during different time frames.

To achieve this, we will use web scraping techniques to gather data on doctors' availability from various online sources, including healthcare websites, online directories, and other relevant sources. We will then clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and accuracy.

Next, we will perform EDA on the cleaned data to extract useful insights and trends related to doctors' availability. This analysis will involve visualizing the data using charts and graphs, identifying patterns and correlations, and generating statistical summaries.

In conclusion, our project combines web scraping and EDA to provide valuable insights into the availability of doctors in a specific area. Our analysis can be used to inform healthcare policies and practices, improve access to healthcare services, and ultimately enhance the quality of life for individuals in the target area.
